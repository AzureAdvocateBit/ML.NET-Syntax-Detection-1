# RedCloth doesn't work well with the Prism syntax highlighting lirbary due to the way it handles <code> blocks when it comes to newlines using bc..
# But we can add a config/initializers/redcloth.yml file to our Rails app and monkey patch it so it does.
#
# So, this monkey patch is to make RedCloth not split the bc.. code blocks on newlines.
# To actually use it with Prism the syntax should look like this:
# bc(language-ruby).. whatever multi-line code you want to display goes here

  def code(opts)
